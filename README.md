# Tic Tac Toe Discord Bot
This is a Discord bot I made with Node.js that uses slash commands to play a text-based tic tac toe game.
## Commands
/play-tictactoe - starts a new game of tic tac toe

/move vertical horizontal - enters a move for the player, who is always X and always starts

/show-board - shows the current board
